      <h1>Hey there!</h1>
      <p>
        I see you have came here, well first thanks! It means alot.<br /><br />Now,
        to get a couple common questions out the way. <br />1.
        <strong>Do we store anything you enter?</strong> No. Never ever. I made
        this for the sole reason of being able to let out anything worrying me
        and you. If you know some basic HTML you can verify the code
        <a href="https://github.com/gatelogic/thevoid.gatelogic.github.io"
          >here</a
        >. <br />2.
        <strong
          >AAA! How does your website know what I said?I thought it was
          private?!</strong
        >
        Yes, it is private. The website uses some basic JavaScript to detect
        mentions of suicide and display an alert. This was added after talking
        with a few people and deciding that people might need help and I want to
        do something about it. Please email me if you have any feedback on this!
        <br />3. <strong>I have another question!</strong> You can email me at
        either <a href="mailto:contact@gatelogic.me">pr@gatelogic.me</a> or
        <a href="mailto:gatelogiclive@gmail.com">gatelogiclive@gmail.com</a>
        <br /><br />Also, if this site seems quite childish with some of the
        wording, well I am a probable 5 year old at heart.
